# Linear Regression on a Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) Data
This project is part of the homework assignment for the University of Padua's Computer Engineering MSc course. It is an implementation of linear regression on a Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) dataset. The dataset contains hourly average ambient variables Temperature (AT), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH), and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (PE) of the plant. The data was collected over 6 years (2006-2011) from a CCPP when the plant was set to work with full load.

# SVM for classification, without and with kernels
This project is part of the homework assignment for the University of Padua's Computer Engineering MSc course. In this notebook, we explore the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for image classification using the MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0, 1, ..., 9) with each image being 28 pixels by 28 pixels. We treat each image as a vector of 28x28 = 784 numbers, with each number being an integer between 0 and 255. Each image has a corresponding label.

# Requirements
